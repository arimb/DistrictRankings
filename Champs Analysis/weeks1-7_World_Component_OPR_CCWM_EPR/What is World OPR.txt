*** WHAT IS WORLD OPR? ***



First, What World OPR is NOT:

World OPR for your team is NOT the average of your team's Event OPRs.


World OPR is computed by taking the scoring data for all events and solving all that data simultaneously.


For example, consider 2018 Weeks 1 thru 6 thru 4/8/18:

There were 152 events involving 3585 teams and 11955 qual matches.

For each of those 11955 qual matches there were 2 alliances.

For each alliance a linear equation is formed, so there are 2*11955 = 23910 equations.

World OPR involves solving those 23910 equations for the 3585 unknowns (3585 Team OPRs).

Performing this computation can take a long time if you don't use the right tools and techniques.
